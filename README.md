# GraphDAC: A Graph-Analytic Approach to Dynamic Airspace Configuration

## Abstractâ€”The current National Airspace System (NAS) is
reaching capacity due to increased air traffic, and is based
on outdated pre-tactical planning. This study proposes a more
dynamic airspace configuration (DAC) approach that could
increase throughput and accommodate fluctuating traffic, ideal
for emergencies. The proposed approach constructs the airspace
as a constraints-embedded graph, compresses its dimensions, and
applies a spectral clustering-enabled adaptive algorithm to gener-
ate collaborative airport groups and evenly distribute workloads
among them. Under various traffic conditions, our experiments
demonstrate a 50% reduction in workload imbalances. This
research could ultimately form the basis for a recommendation
system for optimized airspace configuration.
